		<p>Located within the half-moon shaped Baie de l'Embouchure, this gorgeous beach features clear, calm, and very shallow waters, making it a perfect choice for families with young children or for those who dislike swimming in waves. The beach offers chair and umbrella rentals as well as a beach bar/restaurant and a water-sports operator. The beach itself is narrow but quite long allowing for plenty of space for visitors to spread out. This beach was one of my favorites on the island not only because I thought it was very beautiful but because I could go very far out and yet the water level would only be up to my waist.</p>
