	<h2>Baie de Grand Case</h2>
	<h3>Insert slideshow here</h3>
		<p>This skinny and narrow mile-long beach lines the town of Grand Case. There are plenty of restaurants to choose from as well as chair and umbrella rentals. We didn't actually use the beach here; just stopped in a for a few moments after a nasty rainstorm on our way to a lolo (BBQ stand) for lunch. I read that the water here is very calm so it's a popular place not only for swimmers but also for visiting boats.</p>
