			<p>Located within the half-moon shaped Baie de l'Embouchure, this gorgeous beach features clear, calm, and very shallow waters, making it a perfect choice for families with young children or for those who dislike swimming in waves. The beach offers chair and umbrella rentals as well as a beach bar/restaurant and a water-sports operator. The beach itself is narrow but quite long allowing for plenty of space for visitors to spread out. This beach was one of my favorites on the island not only because I thought it was very beautiful but because I could go very far out and yet the water level would only be up to my waist.</p>

			<p>Often referred to as the most beautiful beach on St. Martin, this is likely the island's most visited beach. The one mile long beach is packet with numerous restaurants, bars, resorts, chair and umbrella rentals, and several different watersport rentals, including jet skis, parasailing, windsurfing, and kiteboarding. The southern end of the beach is home to Club Orient, which is a naturist (clothing optional) resort. If you are wanting the ultimate beach experience on the island, head straight to Orient Bay and you will not be disappointed!</p>

			<p>Located close to the town of Marigot, access to this beach requires driving over a dirt road. Friar's Bay features several beach bars and restaurants as well as plenty of chair and umbrella rentals. Since access to this beach requires more work than others, it wasn't as crowded as some of the other more popular beaches and appeared to be frequented by more locals than tourists. At the very northern end of the beach there is a trail that leads to Anse Heureuse (Happy Bay Beach).</p>

			<p>This beach is reached via a 10-15 minute hike from Friar's Bay Beach. The beach is known by locals as being one of the last hidden gems on the island. The beach is not listed as having any facilities but on the day I visited there was some sort of event going on as there was music playing and a vendor selling food. I don't know if that's because it was a holiday (Easter) but if you plan to come here I would assume that there won't be any facilities available. The sand was remarkably soft and clean and the beach was wide and expansive. Because it's a bit more work to get here than the other beaches on the island, there was quite a good number of people camping, which I had only seen on Le Galion Beach.</p>

			<p>This skinny and narrow mile-long beach lines the town of Grand Case. There are plenty of restaurants to choose from as well as chair and umbrella rentals. We didn't actually use the beach here; just stopped in a for a few moments after a nasty rainstorm on our way to a lolo (BBQ stand) for lunch. I read that the water here is very calm so it's a popular place not only for swimmers but also for visiting boats.</p>

			<p>This pretty beach was probably the most secluded stretch of sand we saw on the entire island. If you want to spend the day here, you'll have to bring everything with you including food and drink as there is not a single facility available. I would not recommend this beach for families with young children. The beach is quite rocky and Shyawn was actually thrown against a pile of rocks as he was swimming when a wave came crashing in. However, the beach is quite picturesque so if you want a quiet and beautiful place to spend your day, this beach is probably a good choice.</p>

			<p>Famous for its sunrises, this popular beach is located on the Dutch side of the island, just minutes from the French border. This beach offers all amenities, including the popular Mr. Busby's Beach Bar, where we enjoyed a light lunch. At the far southern end of the beach is the Westin Resort, where only hotel guests are allowed to use their facilities.</p>

			<p>This 1.25 mile beach curves along the boardwalk of Phillipsburg and is a happening place with tons of bars, restaurants, and shopping opportunities. The beach is surprisingly clean, wide, and expansive and would make for a great place to spend a day. We visited it as part of our tour through Phillipsburg, although we didn't actually spend any time on the beach. This area is usually quite busy due to its close location to the cruise ship terminal, where on any given day there is usually at least one, if not several cruise ships in town.</p>

			<p>Likely one of the most well-known beaches on the island due to its location immediately next to the airport runway, this beach is famous for watching the numerous airplanes and jets that take off and land just a few yards away from the beach. Small airplanes from neighboring islands such as St. Barts and Anguilla take off and land quite often. However the real spectacle that most visitors want to see are the larger jets, but only a few arrive each day, mostly in the early afternoon so plan your visit accordingly. As the planes come in, many visitors rush to the sand immediately below where the plane will fly over. The sound of the planes as they arrive is unimaginably loud and almost surreal as it feels as though you can nearly touch the bottom of the jet with your hand. My favorite part though was when the jets took off. People go running towards the area of sand directly in front of the runway, and a select few are brave enough (or stupid enough?) to make their way to the fence that borders the airport and cling on for dear life. When the jet takes off, many of these said people are literally blown off of the fence. It's quite the entertainment! In terms of the beach itself, it's very beautiful, though not very wide and there are several beach bars where one can purchase food and beverage. However, I do not remember seeing beach chairs or umbrella rentals being available, so plan accordingly. Although it could easily be a beach to spend an entire day at, I think that most people stay just long enough to watch a few planes come in and take off.</p>

			<p>Located just to the west of the airport, this beach is very popular amongst locals. Prior to Hurricane Luis (which occurred in 1995), this beach used to be the busiest on the island as it was home to the island's largest resort. Unfortunately, the resort was destroyed by the hurricane. The beach is bordered by the island's only golf course and so parking is limited. Mullet Bay offers all the amenities one would look for including chair and umbrella rentals, restaurants, bars, and water sports equipment. This was Shyawn's favorite beach of the trip.</p>

			<p>The "official" nude beach of the island, Cupecoy Beach is a string of three beaches bordered by beautiful and dramatic sandstone cliffs. The beach is very well protected from the wind, so plan to come here and sweat, sweat, sweat. The surf is quite rough here and there is a steep drop-off so this is not a suitable beach for children or weak swimmers. Additionally, the warnings of it being a nude beach are quite accurate.  Of the 100 or so people on the beach we arrived at, only about five weren't naked. Although we were used to the topless sunbathers, it was quite shocking to see that nearly everyone was nude. As a result, I only snapped a few photos of the beach since I didn't want to offend anyone. There were chair and umbrella rentals available at the beach we went to, but the food vendor appeared to be up in the parking lot, which was a steep walk up. The umbrella rentals here are absolutely mandatory as we baked in that hot sun since there was no wind.</p>
