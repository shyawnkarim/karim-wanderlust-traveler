		<h2>Le Galion</h2>
		<h3>Insert slideshow here</h3>
		<p>Located within the half-moon shaped Baie de l'Embouchure, this gorgeous beach features clear, calm, and very shallow waters, making it a perfect choice for families with young children or for those who dislike swimming in waves. The beach offers chair and umbrella rentals as well as a beach bar/restaurant and a water-sports operator. The beach itself is narrow but quite long allowing for plenty of space for visitors to spread out. This beach was one of my favorites on the island not only because I thought it was very beautiful but because I could go very far out and yet the water level would only be up to my waist.</p>

		<h2>Baie Orientale (Orient Bay)</h2>
		h3>Insert slideshow here</h3>
		<p>Often referred to as the most beautiful beach on St. Martin, this is likely the island's most visited beach. The one mile long beach is packet with numerous restaurants, bars, resorts, chair and umbrella rentals, and several different watersport rentals, including jet skis, parasailing, windsurfing, and kiteboarding. The southern end of the beach is home to Club Orient, which is a naturist (clothing optional) resort. If you are wanting the ultimate beach experience on the island, head straight to Orient Bay and you will not be disappointed!</p>

		<h2>Baie des Peres (Friar's Bay)</h2>
		<h3>Insert slideshow here</h3>
		<p>Located close to the town of Marigot, access to this beach requires driving over a dirt road. Friar's Bay features several beach bars and restaurants as well as plenty of chair and umbrella rentals. Since access to this beach requires more work than others, it wasn't as crowded as some of the other more popular beaches and appeared to be frequented by more locals than tourists. At the very northern end of the beach there is a trail that leads to Anse Heureuse (Happy Bay Beach).</p>

	<!--Happy Bay-->
	<div data-role="page" id="happy">
		<h1>WANDERLUST TRAVELER</h1>
		<h2>Anse Heureuse Beach (Happy Bay Beach)</h2>
		<h3>Insert slideshow here</h3>
		<p>This beach is reached via a 10-15 minute hike from Friar's Bay Beach. The beach is known by locals as being one of the last hidden gems on the island. The beach is not listed as having any facilities but on the day I visited there was some sort of event going on as there was music playing and a vendor selling food. I don't know if that's because it was a holiday (Easter) but if you plan to come here I would assume that there won't be any facilities available. The sand was remarkably soft and clean and the beach was wide and expansive. Because it's a bit more work to get here than the other beaches on the island, there was quite a good number of people camping, which I had only seen on Le Galion Beach.</p>

	<!--Grand Case-->
	<div data-role="page" id="grand_case">
		<h1>WANDERLUST TRAVELER</h1>
		<h2>Baie de Grand Case</h2>
		<h3>Insert slideshow here</h3>
		<p>This skinny and narrow mile-long beach lines the town of Grand Case. There are plenty of restaurants to choose from as well as chair and umbrella rentals. We didn't actually use the beach here; just stopped in a for a few moments after a nasty rainstorm on our way to a lolo (BBQ stand) for lunch. I read that the water here is very calm so it's a popular place not only for swimmers but also for visiting boats.</p>

	<!--Plumb Bay-->
	<div data-role="page" id="plumb">
		<h1>WANDERLUST TRAVELER</h1>
		<h2>Baie de Prunes (Plumb Bay)</h2>
		<h3>Insert slideshow here</h3>
		<p>This pretty beach was probably the most secluded stretch of sand we saw on the entire island. If you want to spend the day here, you'll have to bring everything with you including food and drink as there is not a single facility available. I would not recommend this beach for families with young children. The beach is quite rocky and Shyawn was actually thrown against a pile of rocks as he was swimming when a wave came crashing in. However, the beach is quite picturesque so if you want a quiet and beautiful place to spend your day, this beach is probably a good choice.</p>
