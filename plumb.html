	<h2>Baie de Prunes (Plumb Bay)</h2>
	<h3>Insert slideshow here</h3>
		<p>This pretty beach was probably the most secluded stretch of sand we saw on the entire island. If you want to spend the day here, you'll have to bring everything with you including food and drink as there is not a single facility available. I would not recommend this beach for families with young children. The beach is quite rocky and Shyawn was actually thrown against a pile of rocks as he was swimming when a wave came crashing in. However, the beach is quite picturesque so if you want a quiet and beautiful place to spend your day, this beach is probably a good choice.
