	<h2>Baie des Peres (Friar's Bay)</h2>
	<h3>Insert slideshow here</h3>
		<p>Located close to the town of Marigot, access to this beach requires driving over a dirt road. Friar's Bay features several beach bars and restaurants as well as plenty of chair and umbrella rentals. Since access to this beach requires more work than others, it wasn't as crowded as some of the other more popular beaches and appeared to be frequented by more locals than tourists. At the very northern end of the beach there is a trail that leads to Anse Heureuse (Happy Bay Beach).</p>
