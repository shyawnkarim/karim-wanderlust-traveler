	<h2>Anse Heureuse Beach (Happy Bay Beach)</h2>
	<h3>Insert slideshow here</h3>
		<p>This beach is reached via a 10-15 minute hike from Friar's Bay Beach. The beach is known by locals as being one of the last hidden gems on the island. The beach is not listed as having any facilities but on the day I visited there was some sort of event going on as there was music playing and a vendor selling food. I don't know if that's because it was a holiday (Easter) but if you plan to come here I would assume that there won't be any facilities available. The sand was remarkably soft and clean and the beach was wide and expansive. Because it's a bit more work to get here than the other beaches on the island, there was quite a good number of people camping, which I had only seen on Le Galion Beach.</p>
